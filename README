README

ogre is an ogg-ripping script inspired by autorip, but designed to
allow the user the opportunity to enter track information and send the
info off to freedb for the next user.  I wrote it because I got tired
of autorip not knowing about my less-well-known discs but was spoiled
by not having to type very much to rip.

ogre is unapologetically ogg-specific.  Ogg Vorbis sounds better
than MP3 and is not subject to nasty patents.  Folks with MP3
players with no ogg capability should use some other ripping
script, sorry.

ogre depends on Ben Gertzfield's excellent cddb-py package; check
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cddb-py/ for a copy.

ogre is tested with Python 2.4; later versions are likely to
work but I have not tested them at this point.  Please feel free
to test it and report results to me.  Bug fixes are also welcome,
of course.

To configure ogre, edit the variables near the top of the file.
  interactive
    interactive=0 says only ask questions when there is no alternative
    interactive=1 says go ahead and ask a few questions when confused
    interactive=2 says to edit data for each disc
  rip_device
    Chooses the cdrom device to rip from
  bitrate
    Selects a target bitrate (ogg files are variable bit rate,
    this is a target average bitrate).
  names
    A dictionary specifying file and directory names.  All file
    and directory names get substituted with the following
    variables in context:
      martist   The artist's name encoded as a legal filename component string
      mtitle    The album title encoded as a legal filename component string
      category  The category string, which had better be a legal filename
    Additionally, encfile has the following variables available
      mttitle   The track title encoded as a legal filename component string
      track     An integer track number within an album
    The dictionary entries are:
      wavdir
        Directory pattern in which to store raw data tracks as they
	are copied from the disk
      wavcap
        Eventually will be used to put a rough limit on the amount
	of disk space used for wav files.  Unused until we are
	putting multiple discs into the wavdir because of full
	pipelining
      encdir
        Directory pattern into which to encode ogg files.  Not the final
	location, a temporary directory.
      encfile
        Filename pattern of each encoded individual track
      oggdir
        Directory pattern for final location of encoded ogg files.
      home
        User's home directory
      info
        Full path to file to which to write data files as sent to freedb
  submit_address
    If you are making modifications to the source code, please
    test them by setting submit_address = "test-submit@freedb.org"
    until your modifications are proven.  Doing otherwise will
    invite the wrath of the wonderful volunteers who run the
    freedb service.
  ogre_version
    If you are making significant modifications to the source code,
    please change ogre_version to something like "<n>.<m>-<yourinitials>"
    so that freedb entries are properly marked.  Thanks!
